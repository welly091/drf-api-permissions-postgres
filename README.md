# Lab: 32
## Permissions & Postgresql
### Author: Yu-Wei Hsieh
#### Features - General
- You have been supplied with two demos, each presenting a key new feature.
  - One demonstrates how to restrict access to portions of your APIs data.
  - The other demonstrates switching over to using postgres vs sqlite
- Your job is to merge the functionality of both demos.
-Customize your project to use different application features/models than what was used in demos. 
#### Features - Django REST Framework
- Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
- Adjust project’s permissions so that only authenticated user’s have access to API.
- Add a custom permission so that only appropriate users can update or delete it.
  - Exactly what this means will depend on your application, so if you have any questions about “appropriate users” means reach out to TA/Instructor.
- Add ability to switch user’s directly from browsable API.

#### Features - Docker
- NOTE Refer to demo for built out Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml examples.
- create Dockerfile based off python:3.10-slim
- create docker-compose.yml to run Django app as a web service.
- enter docker-compose up --build to start your site.
- add postgres as a service
  - Note: It is not required to include a volume so that data can persist when container is shut down.
- Go to browsable api and confirm site properly restricts users based on their permissions.
